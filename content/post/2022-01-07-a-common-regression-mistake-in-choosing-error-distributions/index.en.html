<p>I recently saw several related errors come up in multiple presentations. The presenters claimed that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Deviations from normality made linear regression inappropriate to use, and</li>
<li>A density estimate of your data could be useful in choosing the distributional form of your response variable (a normal distribution in this case).</li>
</ol>
<p>Both are incorrect, but itâ€™s worth reviewing the basics again to understand why.</p>
<p>Regression can be understood as a way to directly model some output <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given some information <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. It is natural to condition on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> when doing so, since for some function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> of the observed <span class="math inline">\(X=x\)</span>, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathbb{E}[L(f(x), Y)]=\mathbb{E}\,\big[\mathbb{E} \,L(f(x)|Y\,|\,x\big],\]</span>
and the quantity on the right gives the optimal predictor of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as $g(x)= $</p>
